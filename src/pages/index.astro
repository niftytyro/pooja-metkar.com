          Iâ€™m a Bangalore-based UX designer, currently leading design for <b
            >LendingðŸ’°</b
          >
          and <b>InvestmentsðŸ“ˆ</b> at Jupiter. I graduated from the <b
            >National Institute of Design</b
          >, Ahmedabad in 2014 and have more than 9 years of experience
          designing a diverse range of physical and digital products. My work
          revolves around simplicity, understanding user emotions, and creating
          products that truly resonate with them.
          <br /><br />
          Beyond work, you'll often find me creating illustrationsðŸŽ¨ with everyday
          objects for delight. I love being outdoors, playing sports, going on hikes
          or high-altitude treks. I also enjoy reading novels, mostly fantasy fictionðŸ§™.

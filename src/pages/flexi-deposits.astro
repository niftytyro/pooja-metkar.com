      <p class="section-content">
        We found that 32% of Fixed Deposits are broken prematurely within 2
        months of booking. 60% of these deposits were rebooked at 65% of the
        original amount. Our hypothesis was that users needed money urgently but
        had no option to withdraw partially. This forced them to break the
        entire FD and lose earned interest.
        <br /><br />
        To solve this, we introduced Flexi FD, a feature that allows users to withdraw
        partially from their FDs.

        I designed the entire experience for booking and managing a Flexi FD
        from scratch, including its discovery on the homepage and within the FD
        types. I also conceptualised the branding and animations for the 'How It
        Works' screen.

      <ContentSection title="What is a Flexi FD?">
        <p class="section-content">
          When conceptualising this, we wanted to make it clear that a user's
          total FD amount would be automatically divided into 3 or 5 equal
          parts. Users can choose to withdraw any part based on amount they
          need. The remaining parts continue to earn interest until maturity.
        </p>

  <div class="max-w-desktop-content my-16 mx-auto space-y-16">
    <ContentSection title="Dashboard and Breaking Experience">
      <p class="section-content">
        To break an FD, users can select the parts they wish to withdraw, review
        a summary and proceed. We guide users by clearly displaying how early
        withdrawals affect interest rates. If they select multiple parts, each
        part is broken separately. I designed a stepper to help users easily
        break one part at a time without confusion.
        <br /><br />
        Finally on the success screen, we reassure them that the remaining parts
        of the FD continue to earn interest.

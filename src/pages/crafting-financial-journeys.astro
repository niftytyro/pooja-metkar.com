        Jupiter is a digital banking app that helps users manage their finances,
        offering services like savings accounts, UPI payments, loans, credit
        cards, spends tracker, and various investment products. As we introduced
        more features, our UI became cluttered, leading to many inconsistencies
        that made the app feel less confident.
        <br /><br />
        We decided to redesign the app and created new design principles to craft
        every screen, number, and interaction in a way that a user always feels confident
        about the decisions they make.

        I led the complete redesign of loans experience, covering both pre &
        post-disbursement journeys. I worked with product leadership to shape
        journeys focused on clarity, transparency, and building trust.

          The previous loans tab was cluttered with too many actions, leaving
          users confused. We asked ourselves, 'What’s the key task we want users
          to accomplish?'— selecting the right loan option.
          <br /><br />
          We removed unnecessary elements to help users choose easily. The most critical
          factor in loan selection is the amount offered, so we redesigned the loan
          cards to be minimalistic and easy to compare, with focus on loan limit

      <ContentSection title="Using animations for clarity">
        <p class="text-lg">
          In the previous design, the amount selection screen was static, with
          the slider set to the maximum by default. This confused some users who
          didn’t realise it was interactive.
          <br /><br />
          In the new design, we auto-animate the slider from the lowest to highest
          amount to provide visual cues and improve the landing experience. EMI and
          tenure options now load dynamically based on the selected amount.

          Users need to add a bank account and set up auto-pay before receiving
          their loan amount. This can cause anxiety if accurate information
          isn’t provided. We addressed this by making key copy changes and
          adding helpful notes.
